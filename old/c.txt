 --- Hello world (#1) ---


Let's start our C journey the same way as we would with any other programming language - it's time to make a hello world program!
But first, let's actually go over what a hello world program is.
In fancy words, a hello world program prints the string "Hello world" to the console.
Alright... I proably just made you more confused, so let's see what on earth this means.

Let's start with 'print'. It doesn't really mean printing ink onto paper... it's slightly different.
Whenever a programmer says 'print', they really just mean "displaying something to the user".
So, if I printed something, I show it to the user.

While we're on the topic of a user, let's discuss exactly what it is.
It's kind of in the name - a user is just someone who uses our program.
A user of youtube, for example, is really just someone who uses youtube.
The user of our program is the person who runs our program.

The weirdest word here is probably 'string'. Just like print, it isn't what it sounds like.
Instead of meaning a long line of thin rope, when programming it's meaning is quite different!
In programming, a string is "an array of characters".
This doesn't really help though. What's an array? What's a character?

Let's start with character. A character is basically a single letter, symbol or number.
a, g, L, W, 4, 9, %, !, ) or a space are all characters.
Most things you can type on your keyboard are characters.
