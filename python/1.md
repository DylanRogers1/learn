# Chapter 1: Hello world

First of all, download the latest version of Python [here](https://python.org).

Once you have Python installed, open a new file with the `.py` extension. You could open it in a text editor of your choice, such as *VS Code*, a Python IDE or just Python's built-in *IDLE* editor. I'll name my file `hello.py`.

Inside `hello.py`, type this code:

``` python
print("Hello world")
```

Now, run your code. You should see `Hello world` printed to the console:

``` text
Hello world
```

Let's briefly go through how this line works.

In our code, we are calling the `print` function. To call a function, we add `()` after the function name. Therefore, to call `print`, we type `print()`.  
A function is just a group of code that executes when the function is called. In our case, the `print` function prints some text to the screen whenever it is called.

We can *pass arguments* to a function. This means we are giving *data* to the function. When we call `print`, we can give it some text (a *string*) which it will print to the screen.
