# Chapter 2: Variables

Variables are a key part of any programming language. They allow you to store data for later.  
An example of a variable would be `age`, which could store an *integer*, such as `82`.  
The key thing about variables is that its data can change. `age` could later become `83`, for example.

## Setting variables

Unlike many other languages you don't need to create variables before you give them a value. Instead, we can give the variable a value whenever, even if it doesn't exist yet!

We can assign a variable like this:

``` python
variable_name = value
```

For example, we could set the variable `country` to be equal to `"India"` by typing this:

``` python
country = "India"
```

## Reading variables

To read a variable, you can literally just type the variable's name! If you want to print a variable, just use this syntax:

``` python
print(variable_name)
```

For example, let's say I had a variable called `favourite_programming_language` and that variable had the value `"Python"`. I could print my favourite programming language to the console by typing:

``` python
print("My favourite programming language is:")
print(favourite_programming_language)
```

Which would output:

``` text
My favourite programming language is:
Python
```

Then if I were to change the value of `favourite_programming_language` to equal `"Java"`, the output would become:

``` text
My favourite programming language is:
Java
```
